abstract = {Online testing is a practical technique where test derivation and test execution are combined into a single algorithm. In this paper we describe a new online testing algorithm that optimizes the choice of test actions using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. This provides an advantage in covering system behaviors in less time than with a purely random choice of test actions. Online testing with conformance checking is modeled as a 1.5 player game, or Markov Decision Process (MDP), between the tester as one player and the implementation under test (IUT) as the opponent. Our approach has been implemented in C#, and benchmark results are presented in the paper. The specifications that generate the tests are written as model programs in any .NET language such as C# or VB.

abstract="The problem of generating the test cases is one of the most important issues in the software testing research and practice. Test threads, especially the thin-threads which are the usage scenarios in a software system, are frequently used to generate test cases for the scenario-based software testing. However, the derivation of the test threads is usually a manual and labor-intensive task. In this paper, we propose an automated approach using anti-ant-like agents to directly generate test threads from the UML artifacts. The generated test threads can then be used to generate and to prioritize the test cases for scenario-based software testing.",
